This is my first post! Time to celebrate &#127881;

Although I have been having the idea of creating a website for a long time, it took me until the start of my thesis to finally sit down and get going. After some attempts with Hugo, Jekyll and so on, I thought: "Why not try to use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language for my website?" Luckily, there exists the package [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org) that allows to do exactly that. Even luckier, I came across [this pretty website](https://fredrikekre.se) by [Fredrik Ekre](https://github.com/fredrikekre), which Max Kolowski took as a template. I, in turn, was inspired by [his design](https://maximikos.github.io/). And voil√†! Here we go &#128512;.
