## ESA Design Booster

The [Fly Your Satellite! Design Booster](https://www.esa.int/Education/CubeSats_-_Fly_Your_Satellite/Fly_Your_Satellite!_Design_Booster_pilot?fbclid=IwAR3hcjAva089hKRr8a74cB60zLhuBLy3mbpIcjtmc6AKB5Er1PXpcs9zvpw) is a pilot program of the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/).
It's aimed at students working in the design of a CubeSat mission.
[CubeSat](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/CubeSat)s are miniaturized satellites that have standardized form â€” in LEGO brick fashion, they're shaped as $n \ge 1$ 10cm cubes, stacked vertically.
It's an idea to accelerate and democratize space missions[^1], cutting down on the cost[^2] and effort required to get the spacecraft in-orbit.

Design Booster aims to assist the teams by providing further training during the full project lifecycle and across a wide spectrum of areas from aerospace engineering to project management or even operating the CubeSat while it's in-orbit.
The program is split in distinct phases that are adapted from the typical development cycle of space missions and it follows a fixed scheduled spanning 1.5 years.
In brief, the teams first have to apply to the program.
Then, the shortlisted teams undergo the "Training and Selection" phase where they receive training from ESA experts and in about a month after they have to defend their proposed design in front of a panel of ESA experts.
The selected teams continue on to the next phase, "Baseline Design Review" where they have to baseline their design which is then assessed by the experts.
After this two-month phase is concluded, the teams have about a year to finalize their design.
The program ends with the so-called "Final Design Review", where the design undergoes through examination to check whether the design has been successfully consolidated.

The "Training and Selection" phase kicked off with presentations from ESA experts in Nov. 7.
I was invited to give a talk to share some insight on how working at a long-term space mission project can be, with an addendum on the challenges behind trying to run Space Biology experiments inside a CubeSat.
I flew from Greece to Munich, Munich to Amsterdam, took the train to Leiden and there I was on a rainy day!
