# Hi folks &#128075;

I'm Orestis, and it seems like you want to get to know me a little more. In the upcoming weeks, I'm planning to write a little about my life and what my interests are about, among others. Until then, I hope you find enough on this page to entertain you :)

## About
This is my personal, currently kinda empty website.

## Education
I'm currently getting my B.Sc. in Computer Science (scientific computing + artificial intelligence) by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh), Greece.
