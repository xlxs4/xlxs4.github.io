In a nutshell, I'm a curious, outdoorsy person from Southern &#127465;&#127466;, now living in &#127475;&#127476; who loves to learn, experience, and travel. The long version of it is that I was born at 355 ppm about 30 years ago and was brought up in a tiny Bavarian village not too far from the border to Austria. Since then I've come around quite a bit, lived in multiple German towns and cities, had some stays in Oxford, Vienna, and Oslo, only to drive me up North, that is, Trondheim in Norway. There, I'm pursuing my PhD on global sustainability scenarios. In the upcoming weeks, I'm planning to write a little about my PhD life and what my research is about. Until then, I hope you find enough on this page to entertain you :) </p> <div style="clear: both"></div> </div> <h2 id=in_the_now ><a href="#in_the_now" class=header-anchor >In the now</a></h2> <p>I am a PhD candidate at NTNU&#39;s <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/indecol/">Industrial Ecology programme</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/edgar.hertwich">Edgar Hertwich</a> and <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/richard.wood">Richard Wood</a>, two icons in the field of sustainability research. I develop global pathways for how the UN Sustainable Development Goals can be reached, relying on environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output models. This work contributes to NTNU&#39;s role within the <a href="http://shape-project.org/">SHAPE project</a> whose consortium consists of multiple other institutions including the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the Stockholm Resilience Centre. If you are curious, have a read of <a href="https://maximikos.github.io/research">what my research broadly is about</a>.</p> <h2 id=earlier_work ><a href="#earlier_work" class=header-anchor >Earlier work</a></h2> <p>Prior to my PhD, I worked as Data &amp; Verification Lead at <a href="https://en.climatepoint.com/">ClimatePoint</a> in Oslo and was part of the <a href="https://proset.inatech.de/">PROSET project</a> at the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany. During my research role in Freiburg, I also had the chance to contribute to the teaching of classes on material flow analysis, lifecycle assessment, and a ring lecture on climate change mitigation. This latter ring series was a result of the efforts in the <a href="https://www.s4f-freiburg.de/">Scientists for Future</a> group in Freiburg.</p> <h2 id=education ><a href="#education" class=header-anchor >Education</a></h2> <p>I hold an M.Sc. in Industrial Ecology &#40;2018&#41;, from the very same programme where I am now employed, and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management &#40;2015&#41; from the Ilmenau University of Technology. During and between my studies I had the chance through multiple long-term internships and summer jobs to gain experiences in research, the automotive sector, and the aviation industry.</p> <h2 id=miscellaneous ><a href="#miscellaneous" class=header-anchor >Miscellaneous</a></h2> <p>I am interested in all things science and nature, love spending my spare time out in the mountains or by the sea, and am an avid advocate of the Oxford comma.
